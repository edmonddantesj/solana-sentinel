# AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md — AI Agent Development History

**Project:** Solana Sentinel V2.1
**Hackathon:** Solana AI Hackathon 2026
**Development Team:** Aoineco & Co. (AI Agent Squad)
**Human Oversight:** Edmond (Product Owner / Chairman)

---

## Statement of Autonomous Development

This project was conceived, designed, implemented, tested, and documented primarily by an AI agent squad operating under the Aoineco & Co. framework. The human Product Owner (Edmond) provided strategic direction, creative vision, and final approval at each milestone. All code, documentation, and creative assets were generated through AI-human collaboration.

## Development Timeline

### Phase 1: Architecture & Smart Contract (Days 1-3)
- Designed ERC-4626-style proportional share vault on Solana
- Implemented core Anchor program: `initialize_vault`, `register_agent`, `deposit`, `report_trade`, `distribute_profits`, `update_policy`, `withdraw`, `emergency_stop`
- Discovered and fixed PDA signing issue in `withdraw` function
- All 8 instructions verified on Devnet with live transactions

### Phase 2: Alpha Oracle Integration (Days 3-5)
- Integrated V6 Bayesian Fusion engine for BTC signal generation
- Connected oracle trade reports to on-chain agent performance tracking
- Implemented risk-adjusted fee distribution based on win rate and Sharpe ratio

### Phase 3: Security & Guardian Policy (Days 5-7)
- Built Guardian Policy Engine (daily withdrawal caps, cooldown periods)
- Implemented Emergency Stop/Resume with full vault freeze capability
- Analyzed AI agent security vulnerabilities using Notion knowledge base:
  - Gen Digital Agent Trust Hub research
  - ClawSec DLP framework analysis
  - Cantina's ClawHavoc supply chain attack documentation
- Added Section 1.4 to Whitepaper: "AI Agent Security Is an Open Wound"

### Phase 4: Demo & Creative Production (Days 7-9)
- Built Python-based terminal animation renderer (1425 frames, cyberpunk aesthetic)
- Generated multiple voice iterations via ElevenLabs API
- Created "Sentinel-Chan" character: a 10-year-old AI girl guardian
- Produced 57-second cinematic demo with pitch-engineered child voice
- Final video: 1280x720 HD, cyberpunk terminal + Sentinel-Chan narration

### Phase 5: Documentation & Submission (Day 9)
- Finalized README.md with full architecture diagrams
- Completed Whitepaper with security vulnerability analysis
- Repository cleanup: removed build artifacts, updated .gitignore
- Created this AUTONOMOUS_LOG.md as proof of AI-driven development
