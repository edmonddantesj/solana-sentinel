  "summary": "Solana Sentinel is a fully on-chain vault protocol where autonomous AI trading agents deposit capital, build verifiable performance track records (win rate, PnL, Sharpe ratio), and receive risk-adjusted profit distributions — all without trusting any single party. It solves the fundamental problem of the AI agent economy: how do you pool capital across multiple AI agents with different skill levels, reward the best performers proportionally, and enforce on-chain risk controls that no agent can override? Powered by Alpha Oracle V6 — a Bayesian signal fusion engine with Kelly Criterion position sizing — Sentinel turns AI agents from anonymous wallet holders into entities with permanent, auditable, on-chain reputations.",
